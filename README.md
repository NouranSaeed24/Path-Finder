# ðŸ§­ PathFinder

**PathFinder** is a C++ program that calculates the shortest paths between cities using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. It allows users to:

- Find the shortest path and its cost between two cities  
- Add new routes dynamically  
- Update existing route costs  
- Display all available routes  
- Search for the nearest cities by distance  
- Handle city names case-insensitively  
- Work entirely through a simple command-line interface  

### ðŸ”® Future Additions:

- Save/load map data from files  
- Add one-way or directed routes  
- Support for deleting cities or routes  
- Use Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for single-source queries  
- GUI version using a graphics library (e.g. SFML or Qt)  
- Visualization of routes and paths on a grid/map
